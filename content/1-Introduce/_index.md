**VPC** is the backbone of AWS networking, it forms the foundational layer of networking and security in the cloud. Understanding what a VPC is and how to set up and manage a VPC is essential because it dictates how your AWS resources communicate with each other, with the internet, and with on-premises networks. Learning VPC first equips you with the necessary knowledge to manage AWS resources securely, efficiently, and effectively. It lays the groundwork for understanding how AWS works at a network level, which is crucial for building, deploying, and scaling applications in the cloud. This workshop will start by introducing the conecpt of VPC then we will move to the process of setting up a VPC, where we will learn how to configure subnets, route tables, and security groups to create a secure and scalable network environment. Next, we will figure out what is an **EC2** and how it works then deploy an EC2 instance within this VPC, ensuring that it's correctly integrated into your network, before we establish EC2 instances. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to test the connection to your EC2 instance, verifying that it's properly configured and accessible as intended.
