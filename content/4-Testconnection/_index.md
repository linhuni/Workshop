After created EC2 instances, we need to check the connection of EC2 with the Internet, the connection between public EC2 and private EC2. Testing the connection of a public EC2 instance using the ping command is essential to verify basic network connectivity and ensure that the instance is reachable over the internet. This test helps confirm that network routing, security group rules, and Network ACLs are correctly configured to allow inbound ICMP traffic. Additionally, testing the connection between a public EC2 instance and a private EC2 instance is crucial for validating internal VPC communication. It ensures that the instances can communicate within the VPC, which is vital for multi-tier architectures where different instances need to interact, such as web servers in public subnets connecting to databases or application servers in private subnets. These tests are fundamental to ensuring the overall functionality and security of your cloud environment.
